The dividing of shifts into different tags can be useful, for example if there are multiple shifts at the same time or if only certain publishers are trained in a specific type of public witnessing.</p><p>With every tag there can be a set of template weeks which have been defined previously. By using the automatic option when scheduling, the program can use these template weeks. This saves the project manager or shift manager time when scheduling.</p>
